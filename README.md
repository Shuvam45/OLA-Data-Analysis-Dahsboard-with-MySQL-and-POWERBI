# 🚖 Ola Ride Analysis — SQL & Power BI Project

This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization on a fictional ride-sharing dataset inspired by Ola. It includes SQL queries for data exploration and aggregation, and an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends.

---

## 📁 Contents

- `Ola SQL Script.sql` — SQL queries used to analyze ride data from a simulated `bookings` table.
- `Ola Dashboard.pbix` — Power BI report with interactive visualizations such as ride counts, cancellations, payments, and customer feedback.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL (MySQL)** — for data transformation, filtering, and aggregation
- **Power BI** — for dashboard development and data visualization

---

## 🔍 SQL Analysis Includes

- ✅ All successful bookings
- 📏 Average ride distance by vehicle type
- ❌ Cancelled rides (by customer and driver)
- 🧑‍💼 Top 5 frequent customers
- ⭐ Driver and customer rating analysis
- 💳 Payment method breakdown (e.g., UPI)
- 💰 Total booking value of successful rides
- ⚠️ Incomplete rides and their reasons

Each query is stored as a **view** for reusability and easier reporting.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard visualizes:

- Ride status distribution
- Booking trends over time
- Ratings overview (driver & customer)
- Vehicle-wise performance
- Payment method comparison
- Cancellations and reasons

*(To view it, open `Ola Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.)*

## 🧠 Insights

This project helps answer key business questions like:

- Which vehicle types are preferred?
- How do customer ratings vary by vehicle?
- What are the most common cancellation reasons?
- How much revenue is generated from successful bookings?

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Use **MySQL Workbench** to run `Ola SQL Script.sql` (after setting up your `bookings` table).
3. Open `Ola Dashboard.pbix` in **Power BI Desktop** to explore the dashboard.
